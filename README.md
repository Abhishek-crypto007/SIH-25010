## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution

<ul>
  <li>A <b>multilingual, AI-powered Smart Crop Advisory System</b> delivered via mobile app, chatbot, and voice assistant.</li>
  <li>Provides personalized, real-time advisory on <b>crop selection, fertilizer/pesticide use, soil health, weather alerts, pest detection, and market prices</b>.</li>
  <li>Designed for <b>regional languages with voice support</b> to overcome literacy and digital barriers.</li>
  <li>Farmers simply input <b>text, voice, or crop images</b>, and the system outputs clear, localized recommendations.</li>
</ul>

## Technical Approach

<ul>
  <li><b>Technologies to be used:</b>  
    <ul>
      <li>Programming: Python (AI/ML), Java/Kotlin (Android), React Native (cross-platform app), Node.js/Flask (backend).</li>
      <li>Frameworks: TensorFlow/PyTorch (image recognition), Rasa/Dialogflow (chatbot & NLP).</li>
      <li>Databases: Firebase/PostgreSQL.</li>
      <li>APIs: IMD/OpenWeather (weather), Govt APIs (market prices).</li>
      <li>Optional: IoT soil sensors (moisture, pH).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Methodology and process for implementation:</b>  
    <ul>
      <li>Collect soil, weather, crop, and pest datasets.</li>
      <li>Train AI/ML models for pest detection, crop selection, and fertilizer optimization.</li>
      <li>Develop chatbot + voice interface for multilingual support.</li>
      <li>Integrate external APIs (weather, market).</li>
      <li>Build offline-first mobile app.</li>
      <li>Pilot test with local farmers, refine, then scale.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

## Feasibility and Viability

<ul>
  <li><b>Analysis of feasibility:</b>  
    <ul>
      <li>High due to rising smartphone use in rural India.</li>
      <li>Govt/NGO support for agri-tech adoption.</li>
      <li>AI & NLP tools are production-ready.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Potential challenges and risks:</b>  
    <ul>
      <li>Limited internet connectivity in rural areas.</li>
      <li>Farmers’ reluctance to trust technology.</li>
      <li>Accuracy issues in pest/disease detection.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Strategies for overcoming challenges:</b>  
    <ul>
      <li>Offline-first app + SMS/IVR fallback.</li>
      <li>Awareness workshops and local extension officers for adoption.</li>
      <li>Continuous retraining of AI models with farmer feedback.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

## Impact and Benefits

<ul>
  <li><b>Potential impact on the target audience:</b>  
    <ul>
      <li>Empowers small & marginal farmers with data-driven decision-making.</li>
      <li>Increases yields by 20–30% (based on ICT advisory studies).</li>
      <li>Reduces dependency on middlemen and unreliable advice.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Benefits:</b>  
    <ul>
      <li><b>Social:</b> Better livelihoods, reduced rural poverty.</li>
      <li><b>Economic:</b> Optimized input costs, improved market returns.</li>
      <li><b>Environmental:</b> Reduced chemical overuse → healthier soil & water.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
